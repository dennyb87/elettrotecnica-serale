Electronic systems can be designed to work with analog or digital signals. Analog signals are so called because they mimic the phenomena that they represent, hence “analogous”. A microphone, for instance, converts sound waves into a varying electric current with a corresponding shape. To the contrary, Digital signals are the result converting analog signals into a numerical form through a process called **sampling**. Each sample is taken at regular intervals called **sampling period**. The **sampling rate** (or sampling frequency) is the number of samples taken per second. Electronic systems designed to work with digital signals almost always rely on the binary number system, where all information is reduced into a series of zeroes and ones.
