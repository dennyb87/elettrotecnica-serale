# Types of electronic circuits  

There are two main types of electronic circuits: **conventional circuits** and the modern **integrated circuits**.  

## Conventional circuits

Conventional circuits consists of separate components attached to a base, usually a *printed circuit board* or **PCB**, and connected by wires. These circuits are robusts and can incorporate a great variety of components.  

## Integrated circuits

They consists of a tiny piece of semiconductor (die), usually silicon, which can have millions of microscopic components printed (via photolithography) on the die itself. They are more reliable and cost less than conventional circuits, but they are less robusts.
