# Colour coding  

Printing the value on the components directly is generally avoided as it may become worn out making it difficult to read. To overcome this, an international system of colour-coded bands has been developed.

Bands are read from left to right for resistors, while top to bottom for capacitors:  

* **Bands 1 & 2** gives the first two digits of the value
* **Band 3** indicate the multiplier in form of powers of ten
* **Band 4** represents the tolerance, indicating the range in which you can find the real value when measured

There is also *five-band* variation where the extra band is used to increase the decimal precision of the value.
