## Resistor  

Controls the current in a circuit. With equal voltage, the greater resistance the lower the current. Resistance, which represent the ability to oppose the flow of charges, is measured in *ohms*.  

## Capacitor  

It is a device that can store electric charges. Consists of two metal plates separated by an insulating material e.g. cerami, glass or plastic. Capacitance, whici is the ability to store electric change, is measured in *farad*.  

## Inductor  

Is a device which can store energy in form of electric field when charges flows through it. It consitst of a coil of wire wound around a supporting core. Inductance, which is the ability to oppose a change in current, is measured in *henry*.  

## Diode  

It can act as a rectifier, allowing charges to flow only in one direction, but there are also *light-emitting diodes* or LEDs, which give out light from current.
