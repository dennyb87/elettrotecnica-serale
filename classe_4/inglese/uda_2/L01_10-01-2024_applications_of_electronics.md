* **communications** (internet, smartphones, satellites)
* **travel** (car engine, air crafts, GPS system)
* **industrial and business** (manufacturing, compluter systems controlling operations and processing)
* **science** (simulations, experiments, measurements, electron microscope)
* **healthcare** (CAT scan, MRI)
