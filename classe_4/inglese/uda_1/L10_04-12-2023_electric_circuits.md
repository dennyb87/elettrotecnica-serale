# Simple circuit

An electric circuit consists of three basics components:  

* power suppply (battery or generator)
* load (bulb, motor etc..)
* connections between them (e.g. wires)

It may also contain other elements like:  

* switch (to create a gap between wires preventing the flow of charges)
* resistor (to regulate the current)
* fuse (automatic switch triggered by overloads)

# Series and parallel  

![series_vs_parallel](https://github.com/dennyb87/elettrotecnica-serale/assets/7195133/b20fd6ef-89f7-4b3d-8dc8-047c8eafc8b3)  

A series circuit uses a single path to connect the power supply to its loads. To the contrary, a parallel circuit uses more than one path as shown in figure. While in the former the voltage is distributed between each load proportionally, in the latter each load is subject to the same voltage.  

That implies in a series circuit can exists only one current, while in a parallel circuit since the current it's dependent on the reistance of the components, each branch can present different values of current.  

All household appliances need to operate at the same voltage and therefore electric circuits are designed in a way that when a device is plugged into a socket is effectively through parallel connection.
