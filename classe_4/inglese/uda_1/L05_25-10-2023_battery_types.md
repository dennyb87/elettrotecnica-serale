# Battery types  

Types of batteries can be divided into two main categories: **non-rechargeable** called **primary**, and **rechargeable** called **secondary**.  

### Primary cells  

These batteries have to be discarded after use since they're non-rechargeable. They can be made of:

* zinc-carbon (clocks, scales)
* alkaline (shavers, motorised toys)
* lithium (remotes, calculators)

### Secondary cells  

This type of batteries, or accumulators, can be recharged applying an appropriate current to the cell. They can be made of:  

* lead-acid (motor veichels)
* nickel-metal hydride (digital camera, power drills)
* lithium-ion (cell phones, laptops)
* lithium-ion polymer (electric veichles, drones)
* silver-zinc (aerospace, communication equipment)

### Memory effect  

Some of them can suffer from *memory effect*. These batteries gradually lose their maximum energy capacity if they are repeatedly recharged after being only partially discharged. If recharged from 25%, they will only be able to deliver about 75% of their actual total capacity.
