Matter is composed of microscopic particles called atoms. At the center of each atom there is a nucleus made up of protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting around them. Electrons has negative charge, protons has positive charge, while neutrons are electrically neutral.  

Usually the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons, hence there is no net charge and the atom remains electrically neutral.  

Sometimes atoms can lose electrons. When an electron becomes detached from the atom, it turns into a free electron. By loosing the electron the atom becomes positively charged, also known as positive ion.

This charge imbalance can cause electrons from other objects to be attracted causing a current, this phenomenon is called **electrostatic discharge** (*ESD*) which produces the typical spark.
