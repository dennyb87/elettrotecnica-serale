# Superconductors  

A **superconductors** is a conductor with **zero resistance**. While many materials can exhibit superconductivity, it's currently only possible to make them to do so at **very low temperatures**. These conductors are used to magnetic levitation trains, motors of ships, and MRI machines.  

# Semiconductors  

Materials that aren't very good conductors nor insulators like silicium are called **semiconductors**. These are widely used in electronic devices in that they are very common elements and can be doped with impurities such as phosphorous to create **N-Type** semiconductors or boron for **P-Type**. The P-N prefix refers to the dominant carriers of electric charge in the respective materials.
