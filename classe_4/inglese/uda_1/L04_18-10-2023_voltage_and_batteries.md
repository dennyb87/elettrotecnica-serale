In order for a current in a conductor to exists there has to be a charge imbalance causing some potential difference, this is also known as **voltage**. Voltage is a measure of potential energy per unit charge, or the energy needed per unit charge to move from a reference point to another in an electric field.  

$volt = \dfrac{joule}{coulomb}$  

A device that can supply it is called **battery** or **power supply**. Commercial batteries tranforms **chemical energy** into voltage. They're made of three basic parts: two **electrodes**, and a medium between them called **electrolyte**.
