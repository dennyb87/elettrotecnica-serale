# Predictions  

Depending on what sort of predictions we're making we can use **will + infinitive** or **going to + infinitive**. The former is used to make predictions based on personal opinions or beliefs, whereas the latter is used to make predictions based on evidences.  

* **will + infinitive** $\implies$ predictions based on opinions/beliefs
* **going to + infinitive** $\implies$ predictions based on evidences  

A weather forecaster using information in the present to make predictions about the future may say:  
> It is going to rain on the east coast in the evening

While a friend guessing the outcome of a match may say:  
> I think Red Sox will win the game

# Wh-questions  

Wh-questions are constructed with **wh + auxiliary/modal verb + subject + main verb**. With the exception that when the **wh** is the subject we do not use the auxiliary.  

> Who did **you** give the book to ?
> **Who** gave you the book ?

# Relative pronouns  

Relative pronouns are used to introduce relative clauses which (that's meta) either provides extra details about the preceding noun or phrase, or help identifying what it refers to. Common english relative pronouns are **who**, **which**, **that**, **whose**.  

## Who  

Wee use **who** to refer to people and sometimes animals.  

> He is a man **who** has no sense of humor

## That  

Is primarily used for things but is also used for people. Is used for **restrictive clause**, which means if removed from the sentence it will completely change its meaning.  

> The food **that** I like the most is pasta
> There are parents **that** engage with their kids


## Which  

Also primarily used when the antecedent is a thing or an animal, not a person. Unlike **that**, is used for **non-restrictive** clauses, in other words, it's used to provide non-essential information that could be removed from the sentence without affecting its meaning.  

> My apartment, **which** is quite small, is in London

## Whose  

Used to indicate possession for people, animals and sometimes for things, in restrictive and non-restrictive clauses.  

> That is the girl **whose** dad is my teacher
> My friend, **whose** dog I am looking afer, is on holiday
> It's a big house, **whose** patio is facing the forest
