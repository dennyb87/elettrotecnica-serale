The pronunciation depends on the final consonant sound.  

| /id/       | voiceless /t/ | voiced /d/  |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| wan**t**ed | hel**p**ed    | clea**n**ed |
| nee**d**ed | loo**k**ed    | clai**m**ed |
|            | fi**x**ed     | dama**g**ed |
|            | ki**ss**ed    | cal**l**ed  |

 If it's a voiced sounds, which means it produces a vibration or humming sound in the throat, then use the **/d/** prounciation, if it's voiceless we use **/t/**, while for words ending in **-d** or **-t** we use **/id/**.
