# The first battery  

Luigi Galvani, professor of Anatomy at Bologna University in the 1780s, started experimenting with frogs' dead bodies. He noticed that if touched with a piece of metal their legs jumped. He concluded that a form of animal electricity was generated by the frog's body.  

Meanwhile Alessandro Volta, professor of Physics at Pavia University, became interested in Galvani's experiments, but he wasn't really convinced by his hypotesis, instead he believed electricity was generated by a chemical reaction between the frog's wet body and the two different metals touching the frog.  

He started experimenting with different types of metals, and the best combination resulted from using copper and zinc with salt water. The Volta's pile was born, a pile of sandwiches made of metal discs and cloth soaked in salty water.
