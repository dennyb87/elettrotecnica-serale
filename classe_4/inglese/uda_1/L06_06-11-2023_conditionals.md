# Conditionals  

Conditionals describe conditions and their consequences. The **if** clause describe the condition (*if you study hard*) while the **main** clause tells you the consequence (*you will pass your exams*) regardless of the order:  

>If you study hard, you will pass your exams
>You will pass your exams if you study hard

There are four kinds of conditionals: **zero**, **first**, **second**, and **third** conditional.  

### Zero conditional  

It's used for scientific facts or actions with certain outcomes. It's constructed with **present simple** only.  

>If you **split** an atom it **releases** energy

### First conditional  

It's used to make predictions and constructed with **present simple** + **will** + **verb**.  

>If the battery **is flat** the car **won't start**

### Second conditional  

It's used for improbable situations or impossible now and ever. It's constructed with **past simple** + **would** + **verb**.  

>If I **met** Elon Musk I **would ask** for a job

### Third conditional  

It's used to describe a different past or consequences of actions that never happened. It's constructed with **past perfect** + **would have** + **past participle**.  

>If we **had thrown** the batteries in the fire they **would have exploded**
