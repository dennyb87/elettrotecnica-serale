# Conductors and insulators  

![conductors_vs_insulators](https://github.com/dennyb87/elettrotecnica-serale/assets/7195133/117d9b7c-ac8c-4c31-b57a-dc93bfd1ae7d)  

Materials where electrons can flow easily are called conductros. Metals are good **conductors** in that they contains a lot of free electrons, likewise some liquid and gases.  

To the contrary, materials where electrons finds cannot flow easily are **insulator** e.g. glass, rubber, plastic or wood, they opposes the flow of charges.  

Insulators are important for electrical safety, in fact electrical cables are made of a conducting material covered with an insulator to make them safe to touch.
