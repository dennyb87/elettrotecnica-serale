# Advantages of automation  

There are several areas in which machines perform significantly better than humans, and often at lower cost.  

* **highly complex tasks** - computers can make complex calculations involving several variables which would be too complicated for humans
* **rapid decision-making** - the feedback loop of a machine can be so quick that its decision-making and reaction time is way faster than humans
* **highly repetitive tasks** - The monotony of such type of work makes machines much more reliable as they are not subject to boredom, lack of concentration and the consequent mistakes
* **dangerous tasks** - They can obviously operate in environmental conditions which would be dangerous for people

Automated systems can nonetheless fail, for example aircraft control systems. Paradoxically, more automation can lead to more training for pilots, such that in the event of a fault, a knowledgeable pilot can intervene appropriately on the automated system.
