Automation is defined as task processing through technology with little to no human intervention. This is achieved thanks to a feedback loop in which machines can regulate themselves by comparing their output with pre-configured thresholds and adjust their performance accordingly. This adjustment in response to changing conditions is performed in steps:  

* **measurement** - physical quantities are measured via sensors
* **evaluation** - measured information is evaluated to decide if any adjustment is necessary
* **control** - if necessary the controller will make the actuators to change the system state to be in line with the preconfigured values
