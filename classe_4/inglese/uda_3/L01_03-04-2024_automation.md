Automation is defined as task processing through technology with little to no human intervention. This is achieved thanks to a feedback loop in which machines can regulate themselves by comparing their output with pre-configured thresholds and adjust their performance accordingly. This adjustment in response to changing conditions is performed in steps:  

* **measurement** - physical quantities are measured via sensors
* **evaluation** - measured information is evaluated to decide if any adjustment is necessary
* **control** - if necessary the controller will make the actuators to change the system state to be in line with the preconfigured values


#### Feedback loop  

A loop in which the output of a system is fed back as input in order to allow for self-regulation.  

#### Mechanisation  

The replacement of human workers with machines.  

#### Process control  

It usually refer to the application of automation to control manufactoring operations, but could apply to any process in general.  

#### Sensor  

Sensors are used to measure a physical quantity and convert it to an electrical signal which can be then interpreted by the controller.  

#### Actuator  

Any device capable to modify the energetic state of the sytem e.g. lamp, heater...  

#### Controller  

It generally refer to a programmable device which reacting on inputs is able to produce specific outputs, in form of electrical signals, utilised to control actuators in automated systems.
