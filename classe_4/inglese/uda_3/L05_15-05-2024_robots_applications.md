# Robots applications  

Robots are now used in many fields and in order to carry out their tasks they evolved in different ways.  

### Humanoids  

They replicate human behaviour and are mainly used for entertainment providing services interacting with people e.g. restaurants, but they still have little practical use.  

### Industrial robots  

The most numerous, they are often stationary constisting of one or more moveable arms. Faster, more reliable and accurate than human workers.  

### Transport  
#### AGV - Automated Guided Veichle  

Simply follow track either colored or magnetic moving through stations like a train.  

#### AMR - Atonomous Mobile Robots  

Use map and sensors to move inside an area, go around obstacles and choose fastest path. Most common type of AMR are *Laser Guided Veichles* (or LGV) using laser beams and sensors as the main system to orientate themselves.  

### Appliance robots  

Are used at home to carry out specific tasks without human intervention e.g. vacuum cleaners, lawnmowers. They can move independently around a designated area and use sensors to avoid obstacles and carry out their work.  

### Remote-control robots  

They're not technically autonomous since they need to be operated at distance by a human. Used to deal with unexploded bombs, carry out tasks in space, or perform surgeries where the magnification of the image and precise movement of the robotic arm offer significant advantages. Finally also drones which nowadays are used in many applications.
