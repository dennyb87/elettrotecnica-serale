# Automation at home

An automated heating system relies on a continuous feedback loop to maintain the desired temperature. In each cycle  the actual room temperature is measured by a sensor and fed into the thermostat for comparison with the set point.  

If any corrective action is required an error signal is sent to the actuators regulating the heat output.
