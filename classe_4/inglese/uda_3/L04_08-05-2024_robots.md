# How a robots works  

## Definition  

A robot is a machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. They can resemble a human being or replicate certain human movements, however they're often designed to be functional rather than aesthetic.  

## Components  

Robots are often similar to humans in that they are made up of the same fundamental components:

1. body structure
2. muscle system
3. power source
4. sensory system
5. brain

## Muscle system  

Bodies can differ a lot, some have motorised wheels, others have an human-like artificial muscle system that can either be hydraulic or pneumatic, in both cases a motor is required to turn the wheel or pressurize the fluid to move the joints.  

## Power source  

They operates on electricity and have a battery, or alternatively, plugged into a socket. The electric circuit drives the valves determining the path of the pressurised fluid which will activate the piston and in turn move the joint.  

## Sensory system  

Creating a sensory system is a major challenge, the most common robotic sense is the ability to monitor movement using light sensors.  

## Brain  

A computer often reprogrammable that controls all the elements in the device.
