# Workers in microchip implant trial  

An American company has started testing a new programme aimed at increasing security. Three workers from CityWatcher.com, a company that provides security camera equipment, have volunteered to be electronically monitored. They will have a silicon chip put inside their arms. The tiny device is the size of a grain of rice and will send out radio signals. These will provide information to a central monitoring system that will give the workers access to secure areas of the workplace. The chips were originally designed for medical purposes and rescue workers used them after Hurricane Katrina. Sean Darks, CEO of CityWatcher, said the chips were like identity cards. He said the only difference is that they are inserted inside the person’s body. He added they are very different from Global Positioning Satellite technology, which allows people’s location to be monitored. Mr. Darks insisted that they were not dangerous and even decided to have a chip implanted in his own body. However, many people are worried about the issue of privacy. Many believe the technology could be abused and that new laws will have to be made. Mr. Darks said his workers can always choose to have the chips removed.

## Answer the questions:  

1. What are microchips?
   1. In this context, they are tiny identification devices implanted in the body.
2. What do you think of the idea of having microchips implanted in your body?
   1. I think they are a tool that can solve a set of specific problems, and we'll eventually adopt the technology if we find a way to deal with the trade-offs.
3. What dangers do you see in putting microchips in people's bodies?
   1. There are many concerns like not kwnowing long term effects of the chip on the body, data leaks, impersonation etc... Like any other tool it can be abused, and often is more about finding the right balance as fixing the flaws is not possible, so you accept them knowing that the benefits will lead to a greater good, hopefully (that doesn't mean I blindly believe in utilitarianism). 
4. What laws do you think should be made to protect people from abuses of microchip implants?
   1. The question seems to imply that laws are a solution while often are just another way to create different problems. It's really difficult to predict what's going to happen in the future, and that's why the law is always behind. You can't make up a law for a problem that doesn't exists yet, and even if you foresee the problem, is really difficult to predict the problems the law will bring in the attempt to fix the original problem.
5. Can you see a future in which everyone must have a microchip implanted into his/her body?
   1. Yeah I mean we're already implanting microchips to dogs, and as far as I know there a countries like Sweden, where citizens are using this technology as well, so I guess the future is here already. Whether it should be mandatory I don't know, there are things you implicitly accept to do to live in a society e.g. paying taxes, I don't see why one of them couldn't be having a chip implanted.
6. Would you volunteer to take part in such a scheme?
   1. Probably not volunteering as I don't paritcularly like the idea of being a "guinea pig".
7. Would you prefer to have a microchip implant instead of carrying a wallet?
   1. Sounds very practical, no more recepits, no cash, no cards, nothing, yeah I would probably go for it.
8. What would you think if your government asked everyone to have a microchip implanted in his or her body?
   1. Sounds very far fetched since I live in Italy and we're still having long queues in townhalls and using paper documentation for many things. That said I would be mainly worried about the plan to deal with the problems that comes with it.
9.  Do you think governments might misuse microchip implants?
    1.  I guess that's a possibility, but that's also a valid question for many other things like media, health care, etc.. not to talk about they're executive, judiciary, and legislative power. Anything can be misused, so if we need to worry about whether microchips are misused, then we'd need to worry about whether anything else is misused, and that would lead us to the next question which is, should we trust the government at all ?
