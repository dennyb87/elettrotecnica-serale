Alberto found an interesting documentary about climate change and the environment: 

In 2015, 193 countries adopted the 2030 United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. TWO of the most important goals deal with climate change and saving our forests and biodiversity.  

### CLIMATE CHANGE  

Greenhouse gas emissions and the two holes in the ozone layec caused
by human activities, are producing higher temperatures. They are now at their highest levels in history. Global emissions of one of these gases, carbon dioxide (CO), are now 513-per cent higher compared to 1990. Global warming is changing the world's weather patterns.  

The results are more frequent extreme weather events: hurricanes, tornadoes, severe flooding and drought. If the international community
doesn't intervene, average surface temperatures will continue to rise. By the year 2100 us may be more than 3Â°C higher. The consequences for the environment will be dramatic: more ice will melt and sea levels will rise. There will also be a reduction of basic food crops like wheat and maize.  

### FORESTS  

Cover 30 per cent of the Earth's surface. The are essential to combat climate change, protect biodiversity and the homes of the 70 million indigenous population. More than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects live in forests. Every year the Earth loses thirteen million hectares of forests. One of the consequences of forest destruction is desertification. Every minute we lose 23 hectares of land because of drought and desertification caused by human activities and climate change.  

### BIODIVERSITY  

Experts at the International Union for Conservation of Nature have a Red List: a list of vulnerable, endangered and extinct animal and plant species. These estimate that 5,600 species might become extinct in the near future. In 1960, for example, there were 2,000 Northern White Rhinos. In 2018 the last male died. Lions, tigers, rhinos, marine turtles, elephants, orangutans, gorillas and pangolins risk extinction. The main causes are climate change, habitat destruction, poaching and trophy hunting. How many will be extinct when the sustainable development programme finishes in 2030?
