# Have to / don't have to  

We use *have to* to express necessity.  
We use *don't / doesn't have to* to indicate there is no need to, so the action  
is optional or not necessary.  
*Have to* is not a modal verb, so it can be used in all tenses.  

"*I have to study for my exam*"
"*I don't have to study for my exam*"  


# Must / mustn't  

Must is used for permissions, obligation, and possibility.  
The negative form means something is prohibited.  

"*You must not give my credit card details to anyone*"  

The affirmative / interrogative form is rare, we normally use *have to* instead.  
 
 "*You must study harder this time*"
