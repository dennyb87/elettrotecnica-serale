# Present simple  50 words  

Whenever I get into something new it's like driving through the fog, words and concepts pops out of nowhere like sparks in the fire, and I feel lost, do you know what I mean ?  

But then, I am not sure why, at some point everything changes, the fog disappears, and I can finally see, clearly, the threads that binds everything together.  

I love aha moments.
