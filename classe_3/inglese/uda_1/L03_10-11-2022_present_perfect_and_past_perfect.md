# Present perfect  

We use **present perfect** to talk about actions and events that started in the  
past and continues the present e.g. *"They have been married for nearly fifty  
years"*.

We use **for** when we want to express the duration of a situation.
We use **since** when we want to indicate when the action began.

*"I haven't played any sport for months"*  
*"He has been my teacher since I started school"*  

We use **ever** in questions and **never** in statements to signify *"at any time until now"*.  

*"Have you ever been out with Jo ?"*  
*"I have never heard that name"*  

# Past perfect  

Past perfect is used to show completed actions, conditional statements, to form questions, and as a negative.  
Is is created by adding *have* or *had* to the *past participle* form of the verb.  

Here we're talking about a **completed action**.  

*"She has been to Tokyo"* 
*"She has gone to Tokyo"*  

Note that the *been* variation implies she has been to Tokyo and came back, while *gone* implies she stayed.  

Here we're making a **conditional statement**, a **question**, and a **negation**.

*"If she had studied for her exam, she would have passed. "*  
"*Have you seen my shoes ?*"  
"*I had not eaten at that restaurant before today*"
